> Abstract : Image restoration is a challenging ill-posed problem which also has been a long-standing issue. 
> However, most of learning based restoration methods are proposed to solve one degradation type which means they are lack of the generalization.
> In this paper, we proposed a multi-branch restoration model inspired from the Human Visual System of Retina Ganglion Cells which support well with multiple restoration tasks in a general framework.
>  Our experiments show that the proposed multi-branch architecture, called CMFNet, performs competitive results on seven datasets include image deblurring, dehazing and deraindrop which are the common degradations on autonomous cars' camera.
